 For re-creating the scene in unity, I began by creating a water shader (Editing the one from the lecture) so that the sin wave works a little differently. Instead of it being smooth or a sharp triangle wave, I made it so that it was more boxed out and squared by modifying the vert function.

I added a poly poly paper boat to the scene in which I retreived from online at the unity asset store. Here is the link. https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/lowpoly-paper-boat-61369

I then added the toon shading aspect to the water. I created blue ramp texture so that I could add it in.
